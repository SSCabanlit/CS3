		<h1> Melon </h1>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>For someone who dislikes or is not fond of the specific variety of melon used in this beverage, 
			which I believe to be charentais, galai, or cantaloupe, depending on which was used. Even after having 
			tried it for the first time, I really love this flavor.</li>
			<li>Coincidentally, every beverage I purchase contains more nata de coco than is typical for a drink.</li>
			<li>It tastes like melon, but it's more sweeter and more delicious than the melon I mentioned.</li>
		</ul>
