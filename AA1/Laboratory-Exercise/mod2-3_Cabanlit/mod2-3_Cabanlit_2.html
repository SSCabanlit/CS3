		<p> The image in my favorite playlist is this collage of four images. My playlist includes my favorite current OPM 
		songs that I enjoy and can relate to. The songs on this playlist are typically the ones I sing along to when studying or relaxing. 
		The lyrics of the composers and how effectively they performed the songs gave me comfort.</p>
