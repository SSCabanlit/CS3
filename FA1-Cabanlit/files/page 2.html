		<h1> Lychee</h1>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>Since I haven't tried the actual lychee, this is the closest example I have of what the fruit would taste like.</li>
			<li>Even though it's a little too sweet, you won't be able to get enough of how delicious it tastes.</li>
			<li>A lot of drinks have lychee flavor, therefore it's quite overrated, but the nata de coco in the mogu mogu
			drink makes it very distinctive and unique.</li>
